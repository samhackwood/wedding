    <h1 class="text-center">Projects - Green Gobblin'</h1>
    <h3 class="text-center">4th Year Integrated Masters Project</a></h3>
    <p>Built as part of the group project module <a
        href="http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/intranet/teaching/public/modules/level4/com4525.html"
        class="my-link">Genesys</a> at the University of Sheffield, the aim of this website was to encourage people to
      think more about the impact different lifestyles can have on our planet.</p>
    <p>Green Gobblin' is a recipe sharing website where you can create, view, search for and comment on recipes, as you
      might expect from a number of similar sites. The twist here is that your recipe's CO2 impact will be measured and
      scored based on how many kilograms of CO2 are generated per kilogram of food.</p>
    <p>The user is given categories for each ingredient they add to a recipe, which corresponded to the dataset we used
      for calculating climate impact. We then give a breakdown including the score for the whole recipe, as well as how
      much an individual ingredient contributes towards it.</p>
    <p>Development was completed under an iterative Agile process with 2-week sprints, with regular standups and a
      kanban board for task management and assigning work. Although we were instructed to use Agile as part of the
      module, I feel we truly embraced it. We had defined criteria for moving through each column in the kanban board
      and effectively split our work up into manageable user stories. We prioritised stories based on their impact to
      the user and although we didn't complete every feature we envisioned at the start, the final product was still
      feature-rich and stable.</p>
    <p>Within the module, we were tasked with generating ideas based on a choice of prompt ('Helping people make their
      lives more sustainable'), conducting customer research, and planning how the website could function in the 'real
      world' as a business. Having produced a landing page and again analysing how users responded to the idea, we spent
      our second semester producing a usable version of the website.</p>
    <p>The site is built in Rails 6, with a PostgreSQL database. We made extensive use of both unit testing with RSpec
      and end-to-end testing with Capybara, so much so that we needed to request a longer timeout for our CI builds! The
      frontend layout makes use of Bootstrap 4, with libraries like cocoon and simple_form enabling us to produce it in
      the time constraint.</p>
    <p>We attained a 1st-class grade for the project, and it was one of the most fulfilling parts of my 4th year!</p>
